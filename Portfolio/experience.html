                    -- <br>
                    the following pictures were taken during a trip to 
                    europe the summer of 2020. the architecture and intricate buildings 
                    intruigued me. the photos feature neutral, 
                    soft hues that contrast with more bronzed architecture.

                    this photo was taken on a roadtrip passing through monteray. taken 
                    in the transitional spring, i was inspired by the contrast between the 
                    vivid iceplants and the greying sky.

                    -- <br>
                    this photo was taken on mount. tamalpais right before a sunset. the colors 
                    of the sky contrast with the silhuette of the mountainside, and the textures 
                    of the mountain, clouds, and ocean are visible.
