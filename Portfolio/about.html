                Ever since her hands could hold a camera, Julia has been taking photos of her surroundings and 
                travels. Inspired by scrapbooking at a young age, her interest for travel photography grew. 
                Her favorite country that she's been to is Australia for its diverse wildlife and vibrant city life.
                As of 16-years-old, she has visited 10+ countries and 5 out of the 7 continents, taking photos 
                of sceneries that capture moments of memories and awe.

                Julia is a student, dancer, and mentor at Menlo School. Outside of classes, 
                she enjoys building robots with her robotics team, biking around the Bay Area Peninsula, and 
                jamming out to the bass.
